## üíº For Employers: Understanding the System

### üìã Daily Performance Entry - What You Need to Know

Our system captures **8 key performance indicators** that automatically calculate bonuses:

| Field | What It Means | Impact on Bonus | Example |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Meeting Hours** | Time spent in meetings (reduces available work time) | Indirect - affects efficiency | 2.5 hours |
| **Assigned Hours** | Target working hours for the day | Baseline for calculations | 9 hours |
| **Completed Hours** | Actual productive work completed | Direct - more hours = more points | 8.5 hours |
| **Complexity Factor** | Task difficulty multiplier | Direct - harder tasks = higher rewards | 1.2 (20% above normal) |
| **QA Factor** | Quality of work delivered | Direct - better quality = higher rewards | 1.0 (perfect quality) |
| **Task Failed** | Critical failure flag | Critical - failures zero out daily points | No |
| **Leave Taken** | Employee absence | Zeros out the day (no penalty) | No |

### üßÆ Bonus Calculation Formula

```
Available Hours = 9 - Meeting Hours (if not on leave)
Efficiency = Completed Hours √∑ Available Hours
Raw Points = Completed Hours √ó Complexity √ó Quality
Final Points = Efficiency √ó Raw Points (if no task failures)

Monthly Bonus = MIN(
    Total Points √ó Bonus Rate,
    50% of Base Salary  // Maximum cap
)

Bonus Rate = (Base Salary √ó 0.5) √∑ (Working Days √ó 10 points)
```

### üìä Performance Grades Explained

| Grade | Avg Points/Day | Description | Typical Bonus % |
|-------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **A+** | 12+ points | Exceptional performance, exceeds all expectations | 45-50% |
| **A** | 10-12 points | Excellent performance, consistently high quality | 35-45% |
| **B+** | 8-10 points | Very good performance, meets all targets | 25-35% |
| **B** | 6-8 points | Good performance, solid contributor | 15-25% |
| **C** | 4-6 points | Satisfactory performance, room for improvement | 5-15% |
| **D** | <4 points | Needs significant improvement | 0-5% |
